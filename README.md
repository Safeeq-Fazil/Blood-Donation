## Instant Blood Donation Notification System:
A user-friendly blood donation platform connecting volunteers and donors while efficiently managing blood donation requests and volunteer data.
## About
This project addresses the growing challenge of deepfake detection in digital media by developing a real-time, multi-modal system capable of identifying synthetic content. The system utilizes a ResNext Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for frame-level feature extraction, followed by an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze temporal patterns across video frames. By combining these two models, the system effectively classifies videos as either deepfake or authentic. With OpenCV for frame processing and PyTorch for training, this approach leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect artifacts in manipulated media, enhancing digital fraud prevention in diverse applications.
## Features
1. Provides a real-time platform for managing blood donation activities.  
2. Displays volunteer and donor data with interactive dashboards.  
3. Integrates Google Sheets for dynamic data synchronization.  
4. Automates updates using Google Apps Script for seamless operation.  
5. Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsive web design.  
6. Enhances coordination in blood donation and emergency healthcare efforts.  

### System Requirements and Development Setup for Blood Donation Platform

* **Operating System**: Supports a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or later) compatible with modern web technologies.  
* **Development Environment**: Node.js and Python 3.8+ for handling server-side scripts and automation.  
* **Backend Frameworks**: Google Apps Script for integration with Google Sheets and automated data management.  
* **Frontend Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (with frameworks like React or vanilla JavaScript for responsiveness).  
* **Version Control**: Git for collaborative development and efficient version tracking.  
* **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for editing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Apps Script code.  
* **Additional Dependencies**: Includes libraries or frameworks such as Axios (for API calls), Bootstrap (for styling), and relevant JavaScript animation libraries for enhanced user interface experience.
